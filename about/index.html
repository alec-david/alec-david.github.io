  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>
  	I'm a software developer living in Cleveland, OH. I am currently working as a developer at Acumen Solutions where I have worked on projects to create time tracking and correspondence management software.
  	<br><br>
  	In my free time, I am also working for Brilliant Sole - a startup that is reinventing how virtual reality video games are controlled. Check out some of the  cool problems that Brilliant Sole is solving at our website:

    Most of my experience is in Java and Javascript (Nodejs, ES6, React, Redux). I've also worked with C# and python.
